Mail Archiver - A solution to store and manage offline e-mail files.   
Copyright (C) 2015-2016 Carlos Nihelton <carlosnsoliveira@gmail.com>   

This program was created in an attempt to help management and storage of e-mail files
offline stored for general purposes. In this current implemantation it deals with Outlook(R)
files only, but it can easily be extended to other formats too.

3rd Parties

The following 3rd party code used in this project can be obtained in the following links:

* POLE - portable library for structured storage <http://www.dimin.net/software/pole/>

POLE is a portable C++ library to create and read structured storage. With a
structured storage, you can store files inside another file, or you can even
create complex directory tree, if you want to. The structured storage created by
POLE is compatible with Microsoft structured storage, also sometimes called as
OLE Compound Document, which are used among others in Microsoft Office. However,
POLE has the advantage that it's portable (i.e you can read or write a
structured storage in any supported platform), you don't need to rely on Windows
library. 

* MD5-CC - C++/object oriented translation and modification of MD5. <>

Version: 1.00 (28 Aug 95)
Version: 1.02 (22 Sep 97)

 Translation and modification (c) 1995 by Mordechai T. Abzug 
 Thanks to Martin Cleaver for for making it happy on Windows NT and Solaris.

 This translation/ modification is provided "as is," without express or 
 implied warranty of any kind.

 The translator/ modifier does not claim (1) that MD5 will do what you think 
 it does; (2) that this translation/ modification is accurate; or (3) that 
 this software is "merchantible."  (Language for this disclaimer partially 
 copied from the disclaimer below).

Based on:

   MD5.H - header file for MD5C.C
   MD5C.C - RSA Data Security, Inc., MD5 message-digest algorithm
   MDDRIVER.C - test driver for MD2, MD4 and MD5

* Boost - Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. <http://www.boost.org/>

We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages both commercial and non-commercial use.

We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide reference implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. Ten Boost libraries are included in the C++ Standards Committee's Library Technical Report (TR1) and in the new C++11 Standard. C++11 also includes several more Boost libraries in addition to those from TR1. More Boost libraries are proposed for standardization in C++17.

Since 2006 an intimate week long annual conference related to Boost called C++ Now has been held in Aspen, Colorado each May. Boost has been a participant in the annual Google Summer of Code since 2007.

*Qt <http://www.qt.io>
Qt is a cross-platform application development framework for desktop, embedded and mobile. Supported Platforms include Linux, OS X, Windows, VxWorks, QNX, Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Sailfish OS and others.

Qt is not a programming language by its own. It is a framework written in C++. A preprocessor, the MOC (Meta-Object Compiler), is used to extend the C++ language with features like signals and slots. Before the compilation step, the MOC parses the source files written in Qt-extended C++ and generates standard compliant C++ sources from them. Thus the framework itself and applications/libraries using it can be compiled by any standard compliant C++ compiler like Clang, GCC, ICC, MinGW and MSVC.
