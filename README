Copyright (C) 2015-2016 Carlos Nihelton <carlosnsoliveira@gmail.com>   

This program was created in an attempt to help management and storage of e-mail files
offline stored for general purposes. In this current implemantation it deals with Outlook(R)
files only, but it can easily be extended to other formats too.

3rd Parties

The following 3rd party code used in this project can be obtained in the following links:

* POLE - portable library for structured storage <http://www.dimin.net/software/pole/>

POLE is a portable C++ library to create and read structured storage. With a
structured storage, you can store files inside another file, or you can even
create complex directory tree, if you want to. The structured storage created by
POLE is compatible with Microsoft structured storage, also sometimes called as
OLE Compound Document, which are used among others in Microsoft Office. However,
POLE has the advantage that it's portable (i.e you can read or write a
structured storage in any supported platform), you don't need to rely on Windows
library. 

*Qt <http://www.qt.io>
Qt is a cross-platform application development framework for desktop, embedded and mobile. Supported Platforms include Linux, OS X, Windows, VxWorks, QNX, Android, iOS, BlackBerry, Sailfish OS and others.

Qt is not a programming language by its own. It is a framework written in C++. A preprocessor, the MOC (Meta-Object Compiler), is used to extend the C++ language with features like signals and slots. Before the compilation step, the MOC parses the source files written in Qt-extended C++ and generates standard compliant C++ sources from them. Thus the framework itself and applications/libraries using it can be compiled by any standard compliant C++ compiler like Clang, GCC, ICC, MinGW and MSVC.
